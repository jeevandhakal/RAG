Query: 'What are the rules for passing a school bus?'
Guardrails Triggered: NONE
Error Code: NONE
Retrieved Chunks: 3 chunks, top score: 0.8104
Answer: When a school bus has amber flashing lights, it indicates the bus is about to stop. Passing is allowed, but drivers must use extra caution and be alert for red flashing lights.

When a school bus is stopped to pick up or discharge students and has red flashing lights, along with a mechanical STOP sign displaying alternately flashing red lights, all drivers must halt. You must stop and not pass a school bus with alternating flashing red lights at any time or place or from either direction, including on a divided boulevard.
